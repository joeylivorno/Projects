## Emails
This is the first project I added to the repository, so I didn't want to go crazy. This is a simple interactive program that prompts the user for a string input, and uses regular expressions to find and return any email addresses that are contained in the text. The script shows basic python knowledge such as importing libraries, looping, etc., while also making use of the re module, which is a bit more complex, but still quite simple in this context.
